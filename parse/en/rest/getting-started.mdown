<!-- # Getting Started -->

The REST API lets you interact with Parse from anything that can send an HTTP request. There are many things you can do with the REST API. For example:

*   A mobile website can access Parse data from JavaScript.
*   A webserver can show data from Parse on a website.
*   You can upload large amounts of data that will later be consumed in a mobile app.
*   You can download recent data to run your own custom analytics.
*   Applications written in any programming language can interact with data on Parse.
*   You can export all of your data if you no longer want to use Parse.
