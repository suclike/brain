# Objects

## Object Format

Storing data through the Parse REST API is built around a JSON encoding of the object's data. This data is schemaless, which means that you don't need to specify ahead of time what keys exist on each object. You simply set whatever key-value pairs you want, and the backend will store it.

For example, let's say you're tracking high scores for a game. A single object could contain:

```json
{
  "score": 1337,
  "playerName": "Sean Plott",
  "cheatMode": false
}
```

Keys must be alphanumeric strings. Values can be anything that can be JSON-encoded.

Each object has a class name that you can use to distinguish different sorts of data. For example, we could call the high score object a `GameScore`. We recommend that you NameYourClassesLikeThis and nameYourKeysLikeThis, just to keep your code looking pretty.

When you retrieve objects from Parse, some fields are automatically added: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `objectId`. These field names are reserved, so you cannot set them yourself. The object above could look like this when retrieved:

```json
{
  "score": 1337,
  "playerName": "Sean Plott",
  "cheatMode": false,
  "createdAt": "2011-08-20T02:06:57.931Z",
  "updatedAt": "2011-08-20T02:06:57.931Z",
  "objectId": "Ed1nuqPvcm"
}
```

`createdAt` and `updatedAt` are UTC timestamps stored in ISO 8601 format with millisecond precision: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ`. `objectId` is a string unique to this class that identifies this object.

In the REST API, the class-level operations operate on a resource based on just the class name. For example, if the class name is `GameScore`, the class URL is:

```js
https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore
```

Users have a special class-level url:

```js
https://api.parse.com/1/users
```

The operations specific to a single object are available a nested URL. For example, operations specific to the `GameScore` above with `objectId` equal to `Ed1nuqPvcm` would use the object URL:

```js
https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```


## Creating Objects

To create a new object on Parse, send a POST request to the class URL containing the contents of the object. For example, to create the object described above:

```bash
  curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"score":1337,"playerName":"Sean Plott","cheatMode":false}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('POST', '/1/classes/GameScore', json.dumps({
       "score": 1337,
       "playerName": "Sean Plott",
       "cheatMode": False
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
results = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print results
```

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response is a `201 Created` and the `Location` header contains the object URL for the new object:

```js
Status: 201 Created
Location: https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```

The response body is a JSON object containing the `objectId` and the `createdAt` timestamp of the newly-created object:
  
```json
{
  "createdAt": "2011-08-20T02:06:57.931Z",
  "objectId": "Ed1nuqPvcm"
}
```

## Retrieving Objects

Once you've created an object, you can retrieve its contents by sending a GET request to the object URL returned in the location header. For example, to retrieve the object we created above:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('GET', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', '', {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

The response body is a JSON object containing all the user-provided fields, plus the `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `objectId` fields:

```json
{
  "score": 1337,
  "playerName": "Sean Plott",
  "cheatMode": false,
  "skills": [
    "pwnage",
    "flying"
  ],
  "createdAt": "2011-08-20T02:06:57.931Z",
  "updatedAt": "2011-08-20T02:06:57.931Z",
  "objectId": "Ed1nuqPvcm"
}
```

When retrieving objects that have pointers to children, you can fetch child objects by using the `include` option. For instance, to fetch the object pointed to by the "game" key:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'include=game' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib,urllib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
params = urllib.urlencode({"include":"game"})
connection.connect()
connection.request('GET', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm?%s' % params, '', {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

## Updating Objects

To change the data on an object that already exists, send a PUT request to the object URL. Any keys you don't specify will remain unchanged, so you can update just a subset of the object's data. For example, if we wanted to change the score field of our object:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"score":73453}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('PUT', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', json.dumps({
       "score": 73453
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

The response body is a JSON object containing just an `updatedAt` field with the timestamp of the update.

```json
{
  "updatedAt": "2011-08-21T18:02:52.248Z"
}
```

### Counters

To help with storing counter-type data, Parse provides the ability to atomically increment (or decrement) any number field. So, we can increment the score field like so:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"score":{"__op":"Increment","amount":1}}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('PUT', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', json.dumps({
       "score": {
         "__op": "Increment",
         "amount": 1
       }
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

To decrement the counter, use the `Increment` operator with a negative number:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"score":{"__op":"Increment","amount":-1}}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('PUT', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', json.dumps({
       "score": {
         "__op": "Increment",
         "amount": -1
       }
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

### Arrays

To help with storing array data, there are three operations that can be used to atomically change an array field:

*   `Add` appends the given array of objects to the end of an array field.
*   `AddUnique` adds only the given objects which aren't already contained in an array field to that field. The position of the insert is not guaranteed.
*   `Remove` removes all instances of each given object from an array field.

Each method takes an array of objects to add or remove in the "objects" key. For example, we can add items to the set-like "skills" field like so:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"skills":{"__op":"AddUnique","objects":["flying","kungfu"]}}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('PUT', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', json.dumps({
       "skills": {
         "__op": "AddUnique",
         "objects": [
           "flying",
           "kungfu"
         ]
       }
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

### Relations

 In order to update `Relation` types, Parse provides special operators to atomically add and remove objects to a relation.  So, we can add an object to a relation like so:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"opponents":{"__op":"AddRelation","objects":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Player","objectId":"Vx4nudeWn"}]}}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('PUT', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', json.dumps({
       "opponents": {
         "__op": "AddRelation",
         "objects": [
           {
             "__type": "Pointer",
             "className": "Player",
             "objectId": "Vx4nudeWn"
           }
         ]
       }
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

To remove an object from a relation, you can do:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"opponents":{"__op":"RemoveRelation","objects":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Player","objectId":"Vx4nudeWn"}]}}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('PUT', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', json.dumps({
       "opponents": {
         "__op": "RemoveRelation",
         "objects": [
           {
             "__type": "Pointer",
             "className": "Player",
             "objectId": "Vx4nudeWn"
           }
         ]
       }
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

## Deleting Objects

To delete an object from the Parse Cloud, send a DELETE request to its object URL. For example:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('DELETE', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', '', {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

You can delete a single field from an object by using the `Delete` operation:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"opponents":{"__op":"Delete"}}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('PUT', '/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm', json.dumps({
       "opponents": {
         "__op": "Delete"
       }
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

## Batch Operations

To reduce the amount of time spent on network round trips, you can create, update, or delete up to 50 objects in one call, using the batch endpoint.

Each command in a batch has `method`, `path`, and `body` parameters that specify the HTTP command that would normally be used for that command. The commands are run in the order they are given. For example, to create a couple of `GameScore` objects:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "requests": [
          {
            "method": "POST",
            "path": "/1/classes/GameScore",
            "body": {
              "score": 1337,
              "playerName": "Sean Plott"
            }
          },
          {
            "method": "POST",
            "path": "/1/classes/GameScore",
            "body": {
              "score": 1338,
              "playerName": "ZeroCool"
            }
          }
        ]
      }' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/batch
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('POST', '/1/batch', json.dumps({
       "requests": [
         {
           "method": "POST",
           "path": "/1/classes/GameScore",
           "body": {
             "score": 1337,
             "playerName": "Sean Plott"
           }
         },
         {
           "method": "POST",
           "path": "/1/classes/GameScore",
           "body": {
             "score": 1338,
             "playerName": "ZeroCool"
           }
         }
       ]
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

The response from batch will be a list with the same number of elements as the input list. Each item in the list with be a dictionary with either the `success` or `error` field set. The value of `success` will be the normal response to the equivalent REST command:

```json
{
  "success": {
    "createdAt": "2012-06-15T16:59:11.276Z",
    "objectId": "YAfSAWwXbL"
  }
}
```

The value of `error` will be an object with a numeric `code` and `error` string:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 101,
    "error": "object not found for delete"
  }
}
```

Other commands that work in a batch are `update` and `delete`.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "requests": [
          {
            "method": "PUT",
            "path": "/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm",
            "body": {
              "score": 999999
            }
          },
          {
            "method": "DELETE",
            "path": "/1/classes/GameScore/Cpl9lrueY5"
          }
        ]
      }' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/batch
```
```python
import json,httplib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
connection.connect()
connection.request('POST', '/1/batch', json.dumps({
       "requests": [
         {
           "method": "PUT",
           "path": "/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm",
           "body": {
             "score": 999999
           }
         },
         {
           "method": "DELETE",
           "path": "/1/classes/GameScore/Cpl9lrueY5"
         }
       ]
     }), {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

Note that N requests sent in a batch will still count toward your request limit as N requests.

## Data Types

So far we have only used values that can be encoded with standard JSON. The Parse mobile client libraries also support dates, binary data, and relational data. In the REST API, these values are encoded as JSON hashes with the `__type` field set to indicate their type, so you can read or write these fields if you use the correct encoding.

The `Date` type contains a field `iso` which contains a UTC timestamp stored in ISO 8601 format with millisecond precision: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ`.

```json
{
  "__type": "Date",
  "iso": "2011-08-21T18:02:52.249Z"
}
```

Dates are useful in combination with the built-in `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields. For example, to retrieve objects created since a particular time, just encode a Date in a comparison query:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'where={"createdAt":{"$gte":{"__type":"Date","iso":"2011-08-21T18:02:52.249Z"}}}' \
  https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore
```
```python
import json,httplib,urllib
connection = httplib.HTTPSConnection('api.parse.com', 443)
params = urllib.urlencode({"where":json.dumps({
       "createdAt": {
         "$gte": {
           "__type": "Date",
           "iso": "2011-08-21T18:02:52.249Z"
         }
       }
     })})
connection.connect()
connection.request('GET', '/1/classes/GameScore?%s' % params, '', {
       "X-Parse-Application-Id": "${APPLICATION_ID}",
       "X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "${REST_API_KEY}"
     })
result = json.loads(connection.getresponse().read())
print result
```

The `Bytes` type contains a field `base64` which contains a base64 encoding of binary data. The specific base64 encoding is the one used by MIME, and does not contain whitespace.

```json
{
  "__type": "Bytes",
  "base64": "VGhpcyBpcyBhbiBlbmNvZGVkIHN0cmluZw=="
}
```

The `Pointer` type is used when mobile code sets a `%{ParseObject}` or `ParseObject` as the value of another object. It contains the `className` and `objectId` of the referred-to value.

```json
{
  "__type": "Pointer",
  "className": "GameScore",
  "objectId": "Ed1nuqPvc"
}
```

Pointers to user objects have a `className` of `_User`. Prefixing with an underscore is forbidden for developer-defined classes and signifies the class is a special built-in.

The `Relation` type is used for many-to-many relations when the mobile uses `PFRelation` or `ParseRelation` as a value.  It has a `className` that is the class name of the target objects.

```json
{
  "__type": "Relation",
  "className": "GameScore"
}
```

When querying, `Relation` objects behave like arrays of Pointers. Any operation that is valid for arrays of pointers (other than `include`) works for `Relation` objects.

When more data types are added, they will also be represented as hashes with a `__type` field set, so you may not use this field yourself on JSON objects.
